# TextCNN

## What I do
- use the pre-trained Chinese word vector provided by Shen Li, Zhe Zhao, Renfen Hu, Wensi Li, Tao Liu, Xiaoyong Du, Analogical Reasoning on Chinese Morphological and Semantic Relations, ACL 2018.

- use Top 20 TD-IDF words as Features 

- slightly changes in codes

## Future

- Top 20 tag words are used to classification so far, try to extract more words is worth trying
- Use title/description/keywords to enrich the feature, which would perform better in terms of representing website.
- rnn/LSTM
